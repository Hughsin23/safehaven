# ABOUT

Safehaven is a mobile-first app created predominantly for women to report incidents of sexual assault across Australia. The app allows you to see incidents reported by other anonymous users across cities and to easily report incidents yourself. This is an app that we would prefer to not need, but unfortunately we do. 

# HOW IT WORKS

Safehaven uses Google Maps API so that users are able to seamlessly glide across the map and search for incidents of sexual assault across Australia. When a user wants to make a report, they hit "Report Incident" that is always displayed in the nav bar. Once the user has submitted their incident, we verify their email in our database and then publish the incident with a marker and info box on the map. 

# TECH USED

Safehaven is a full stack application built with: 

- REACT
- HTML 
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- NODE.JS
- EXPRESS
- POSTGRESQL
- AXIOS
- MUI REACT LIBRARY 


# OUR APPROACH

Our team approached this project by first mapping out our application wireframe and user flow.

(Data)[goes here]

We then created a Trello board of features and split them into categories of features that we must have, vs features that would be nice to have once we'd reached our MVP.

We broke down our app into components to build and split into teams for pair programming: 

- App
- Map
- Incident Form
- Database


# BUGS + HURDLES

Current bugs:

- Update when finished to log any bugs

A few hurdles we had along the way: 

- Doing a mobile first design. This was a first for all of us so we had to really plan out how we would make each component work on mobile.
- GitHub
- google-maps-react vs google-map-react 
- More GitHub
- Email Verification (We ended up not using this right now as it chewed too much into us reaching an MVP. This is definitely something we will add as an additional feature in the future.)
- Middleware issues
